<h3>AF14</h3>
<section>
<pre class="stats">          Capacity: 120
               ROF: 12.0/sec
            Damage: 10
       Reload Time: 1.5sec
             Range: 150.0m
          Accuracy: B
</pre><p class="description">
A high-powered, fully automatic rifle. Developed in 2011, this new model boasts considerably higher firepower than the original. It has now been adopted as the EDF standard. In eight years of battling massive aliens on the field, it has delivered continuously strong results.
</p></section>
<h3>AF14-RA</h3>
<section>
<pre class="stats">          Capacity: 200
               ROF: 30.0/sec
            Damage: 6
       Reload Time: 2.5sec
             Range: 120.0m
          Accuracy: B
</pre><p class="description">
An upgraded version of the AF14. This RA model has an improved rate of fire, but loses a bit of range as a tradeoff. It can instantly riddle a target full of bullets. It's effective in close combat, but its designers were clearly more focused on speed than distance.
</p></section>
<h3>AF14-ST</h3>
<section>
<pre class="stats">          Capacity: 10
               ROF: 3.0/sec
            Damage: 70
       Reload Time: 1.5sec
             Range: 250.0m
          Accuracy: A+
</pre><p class="description">
An ST model AF14 upgrade that sacrifices firing speed for power and range. However, since it is the first ST model, its shots travel slowly, making it ineffective against fast-moving targets.
</p></section>
<h3>Fusion Blaster</h3>
<section>
<pre class="stats">          Capacity: 900
               ROF: 60.0/sec×900
            Damage: 25
       Reload Time: ----
             Range: 120.0m
          Accuracy: S+
</pre><p class="description">
An ultra high-energy laser gun. It has a short range, but boasts the destructive power of a tank, making it one of the strongest personal-use weapons known to man. However, that tremendous energy is difficult to control, so once the trigger is pulled, it will fire at full blast continuously until the wielder switches weapons. Recharging it, too, requires special facilities, making it impossible to reload out on the field.
</p></section>
<h3>AF14-RAR</h3>
<section>
<pre class="stats">          Capacity: 150
               ROF: 60.0/sec
            Damage: 5.4
       Reload Time: 2.0sec
             Range: 120.0m
          Accuracy: B
</pre><p class="description">
An upgraded AF14-RA that fires an incredible 60 shots per second, resulting in overwhelming damage when all rounds hit. Ammunition, however, is used up quickly, and the weapon must be reloaded frequently. It also has a frustratingly short range.
</p></section>
<h3>AF14-B3</h3>
<section>
<pre class="stats">          Capacity: 30                          Zoom: 2x

            Damage: 40
       Reload Time: 1.5sec
             Range: 240.0m
          Accuracy: A-
</pre><p class="description">
An upgraded AF14. This model fires three-shot bursts in place of the full auto function -- there is no auto-fire. There is also no recoil from these rapid-fire shots, however, so accuracy is unaffected, and range is actually improved.
</p></section>
<h3>AF15</h3>
<section>
<pre class="stats">          Capacity: 120
               ROF: 12.0/sec

               ROF: 3.0/sec

             Range: 256.0m
          Accuracy: A+
</pre><p class="description">
This ST model AF15 sacrifices firing rate for strength. Though it can't fire rapidly, it has exceptional firepower and doubled range. Additionally, the slow shot speed typical of ST models has been remedied, making this an effective weapon against fast-moving targets as well.
</p></section>
<h3>Fusion Blaster G1</h3>

As it consumes this energy each time it's discharged, it cannot be used during an emergency reload.

Once locked on, even if the enemy leaves line of sight for a short while, the weapon will maintain its lock, which makes this an ideal choice for striking foes who've taken cover. As this 'mind-guide' requires a certain mental discipline, however, only certain people are capable of wielding this weapon.

A specially improved version of the Mirage mind-guided weapon. It has greatly improved destructive power and homing capabilities; however, its output can be difficult to control, resulting in some fairly significant instability. As the direction of each discharge changes, there's more and more risk of hitting the ground and injuring yourself. For that reason, this weapon is highly recommended for aerial use only.

A 15-barreled mind-guided weapon. It can lock on to 15 different targets at once, and after discharge, it'll fire 15 needles of light, which will disperse and pierce the enemy 15 times each (okay, maybe not that last one). When a target is captured within its sight (represented by a red square), it will be automatically locked on. You can then press the attack button to discharge. This weapon was developed for use against huge throngs of enemies, and is not generally recommended for small groups. It also uses the same amount of energy regardless of the number of enemies being targeted, so efficiency is not one of its strong points.

A triple-barreled version of the Geist mind-guided weapon. It can lock on to three targets at once, and can fire three spears of energy at the same time, with greatly improved blast radius and speed. A fearsome weapon, it requires a special talent to use -- so much so that only a few units were ever manufactured before production was discontinued. When a target is captured within its sight (represented by a red square), it will be automatically locked on. You can then press the attack button to discharge, and the energy spears will detonate on impact. This weapon is also excellent at tracking enemies Once locked on, even if the enemy leaves line of sight for a short time, the lock will be maintained. Because of this, it's possible to use this weapon to target enemies hidden behind cover simply by aiming a little high.

The Psiblade's ultimate model. Its destructive power and blast range are extraordinary. Its slower velocity means greater homing capacity -- although the blade does fly straight for two seconds before it locks onto the target. This weapon pushes the human Psionic Link to its maximum and is renowned for having destroyed the nervous system of its initial test subject, resulting in a grave amount of fear and distrust toward it from the masses.

Note, however, that the vibrations generated by this weapon are transmitted through matter, not air, so they'll have no effect on aerial foes. Press and hold the attack button to increase the Vibro Drive output, and when it's reached its max, release to unleash a powerful three-stage attack: a strike, an additional high-voltage strike, and a final electric deathblow.

To use this weapon effectively, the back of your power frame will be equipped with a Side Thruster, which can be used to trigger a high-speed dash.

The Vibro Drive is not suitable for high-speed combat. If you want to engage with a large number of giant insects, equipping two hammers at once is recommended.

A shield equipped with a high-performance deflector. Due to its diminutive size, its damage reduction performance is fairly low, but its deflector is highly reliable and much easier to deploy with the proper timing to effectively block incoming attacks. Press and hold the attack button to brandish this shield and reduce all incoming damage -- though do note that enemy attacks increase the shield's temperature, and when it reaches its limit, it won't be usable again until it's had time to cool down. While some weapons allow you to attack with the shield raised, such as the Blasthole Spear and other one-handed armaments, it is not possible to block with the shield while attacking with a hammer or blade.

An improved Flame Revolver. Discharges flames of much greater intensity than a regular flamethrower by heating its cylinders up to a high temperature, then rotating them at high speeds. Though it boasts tremendous power, it takes some time to reach the necessary temperature, resulting in a four-second delay between pressing the attack button and seeing any results. Due to its powerful recoil, the muzzle may drift upward when firing, so careful adjustments are mandatory for accurate aim. In addition, this weapon must be held in both hands for stability.

</pre><p class="description">
A device that discharges special alloy blades into the air, which then fall down in a predictable arc and inflict massive damage on the target. Due to the high arc, this weapon is capable of striking enemies who've hidden behind walls or buildings, though the need to mount each shot before firing does limit its usability to an extent. However, by equipping two Javelin Catapults at once, this shortcoming can be overcome to produce utterly devastating chain attacks. 

To use this weapon effectively, the back of your power frame will be equipped with a Jump Booster, allowing you to push the ‘use’ button for a boost jump forward.

A heavy cannon that discharges canisters. These canisters then disperse specialized shells within the target area, which bounce off of obstacles and create utter chaos. Though it's a destructive beast within its range, its range is fairly limited, and it takes a significant amount of time to reload. Additionally, the muzzle may drift upward when firing, necessitating careful adjustments for accurate aim.

<pre class="stats">       Laser Range: 700.0m

</pre><p class="description">
A device that sends lock-on information to your allies' homing weapons (missiles, etc.). It has no ability to attack on its own. 
 
Projects a laser to a designated point, 'painting' the target to confirm its location for an ally's weapon. This helps share the load with your ally and cut back on the time needed for establishing locks. It also extends the range of their attacks by up to three times. (For example, if the Fencer has a weapon with a lock-on speed of 3 seconds and a lock-on distance of 100m, he or she can make use of an Air Raider's kit to lock onto a target that's up to 300m away, and it will only take 1 second.)
 
The homing weapon locks onto the precise point indicated by this device, as opposed to a specific enemy. When the homing weapon is launched, it will head in the direction indicated by the laser -- so if the laser is moved after launch, the missile will move accordingly. For that reason, the laser needs to be maintained until the target is hit.
 
While generally only one missile can be launched per lock-on, it is possible to have multiple lock-ons for the same spot, allowing your allies to launch multiple missiles at a single target.  
 
The majority of Fencer missiles rely on the support of these devices. When Fencers are going into battle with missiles equipped, it's generally recommended that Air Raiders accompany them with Laser Guide Kits in tow.

(For example, if the Fencer has a weapon with a lock-on speed of 4 seconds and a lock-on distance of 100m, he or she can make use of an Air Raider's kit to lock onto a target that's up to 400m away, and it will only take 1 second.)

The homing weapon locks onto the precise point indicated by this device, as opposed to a specific enemy. When you allies launch the homing missile, it will head in the direction indicated by the laser. Therefore, if the laser is moved after launch, the missile will move accordingly. For that reason, the laser needs to be maintained until the target is hit.

While generally only one missile can be launched per lock-on, it is possible to have multiple lock-ons for the same spot, allowing your allies to launch multiple missiles at a single target.  

The majority of Fencer missiles rely on the support of these devices. When Fencers are going into battle with missiles equipped, it's generally recommended that Air Raiders accompany them with Laser Guide Kits in tow.

             Range: 400.0m
     Lock-on Speed: 1.0x
  Lock-on Distance: 1.5x
</pre><p class="description">
A device that discharges a beacon to provide lock-on information, marking any foe it hits as a lock-on target for allied weapons. This, in turn, decreases the time it takes to establish a lock and increases the effective range of those weapons. Though these beacons can't offer the same level of precision as a Laser Guide Kit, they also require no maintenance of any kind until a target has been hit, giving them numerous situational advantages. Each beacon also supports multiple lock-ons, allowing for easy bombardment of particularly troublesome foes. Additionally, targets can be attacked as many times as needed; beacons will remain intact even after missile detonation, and any enemies that have been tagged will not be able to shake them off. If it should become necessary to reset a beacon in play, simply press the reload button to destroy it and ready a new one.

A walking tank developed for underground battle. Since it has four hook-like arms and moves in a crawling fashion, it performs well on rough roads and can even scale walls. With its hook-arms, it can also jump high enough to land on rooves or walls in a single bound. In addition, it comes equipped with large lights that can provide essential support to teams infiltrating the giant insects' underground nests. Though designed specifically for underground combat, it performs great above ground too!

A gold-plated version of the Depth Crawler, designed to reflect radar waves -- though it doesn't really do a very good job of this. Only a small number of these were ever manufactured, and they're generally used strictly for ceremonial purposes by unit commanders.

A military bike. One person can ride in the driver's seat, and another in the side car. Can be requested twice in a row and can even be delivered to underground locations. The side car is equipped with a machine gun, allowing for a wide range of frontal fire. Its destructive power is high and its agility sprightly, and with room for two troops, it's a real force to be reckoned with.

This is an older model compared to the SDL2, officially adopted eight years ago. It remains reliable to this day, however. (The air injection-type SDL2 has numerous issues, including low strength, making this modified SDL1 slightly superior in some respects and leading to its re-deployment.) 

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can ride in the bike, though anyone can ride in the side car.

This vehicle is equipped with a state-of-the-art electromagnetic railgun with accelerated shells and rapidfire support. The shells can penetrate objects, and the railgun itself is equipped with a laser sight to ensure pinpoint accuracy. This is a very powerful weapon, but it lacks the blast area of the Howitzer, which can make it somewhat difficult to use in combat against giant insects. To make up for this shortcoming, it's been fitted with two machine guns on its rotating turret, which can be manned from either of the two gunner seats. Gunners should be aware, however, that the seats face whatever their respective turrets are aiming at. Since this vehicle needs to transport the electromagnetic railgun, its mobility and functionality alike are a bit lacking.

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.

In addition, it comes equipped with large lights that can provide essential support to teams infiltrating the giant insects' underground nests.

A huge combat vehicle, spanning a massive 25 meters. Basically a mobile fortress developed for land combat against the giant insects. Easily the strongest armament in the entirety of the EDF. Equipped with a main battleship-class cannon and two rotating turrets, as well as thick armor. The trade-off, however, is that all of these features add to its weight, making it a bit sluggish. Its main cannon is the EDF's state-of-the-art Requiem Gun, originally developed as a naval gun but then later equipped on tanks after reducing the size of its barrel. This has resulted in a further reduction to its initial velocity, so some skill is necessary to hit the desired target.
 
There are two sub-cannons (Howitzers) located on top of the main cannon. The main cannons and sub-cannons all rotate, and due to the location of the sub-cannons, the direction they face will change as the main cannon is rotated as well. There are also Grenade Dischargers equipped on both the left and right sides of the vehicle to halt any approaching creatures in their tracks.

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.

An enhanced model of the Epsilon Armored Railgun. Its shells can penetrate objects, and the railgun itself is equipped with a laser sight to ensure pinpoint accuracy. This is a very powerful weapon, but it lacks the blast area of the Howitzer, which can make it somewhat difficult to use in combat against giant insects. To make up for this shortcoming, it's been fitted with two machine guns on its rotating turret, which can be manned from either of the two gunner seats. Gunners should be aware, however, that the seats face whatever their respective turrets are aiming at. Since this vehicle needs to transport the electromagnetic railgun, its mobility and functionality alike are a bit lacking -- but compared to traditional weapons, its destructive power is excellent, and its armor level is quite high. The engine has had some adjustments made to it, as well, increasing its top speed.

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.

A Walking Fortress Balam is a smaller variety of Moving Fortress. The word 'smaller' is used loosely, however, as this fortress stands over 50 meters tall. Since it's human-shaped, too, it can fight in virtually any battlefield. Though originally intended for an operation to eliminate giant insects, a few snags were encountered that resulted in the cancellation of those plans. Was left in mothballs for quite a while, but HQ suddenly decided to deploy it to stop Erginus. It's not exactly ready for that task, but it did receive some basic maintenance and was finally allowed to deploy anyway.

A vehicle with a new Convergence Guided Rocket Cannon installed. These rockets have a homing feature allowing them to directly target enemies, separating in mid-flight to cover more ground at greater speeds. Because the resulting missiles are small, their individual damage is minor, but the system is designed on the assumption that every last one of them will hit their target. And even when the enemy is moving at a high speed, at least one shot should always hit, meaning some damage will be dealt no matter what. When a target is within its sight, the weapon will automatically establish a positive lock, and it is entirely possible to lock on to several enemies at once. Press the attack button to fire when ready.

A huge combat vehicle, spanning a massive 25 meters. Basically a mobile fortress developed for land combat against the giant insects. Easily the strongest armament in the entirety of the EDF. Equipped with a main battleship-class cannon and two rotating turrets, as well as thick armor. The trade-off, however, is that all of these features add to its weight, making it a bit sluggish. Its main cannon is the EDF's state-of-the-art Requiem Gun, originally developed as a naval gun but then later equipped on tanks after reducing the size of its barrel. This has resulted in a further reduction to its initial velocity, so some skill is necessary to hit the desired target.
 
There are two Smooth-Bore Guns located on top of the main cannon. The main cannons and Smooth-Bore Guns all rotate, but due to the location of the guns, the direction they face will change as the main cannon is rotated as well.

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.

An enhanced model of the Epsilon Armored Railgun ME, still equipped with a Menace Electromagnetic Launcher. This gun fires penetrating shells rapidly and comes equipped with a laser sight, allowing the target trajectory to be fully confirmed via a red line before letting loose. This is a very powerful weapon, but it lacks the blast area of the Howitzer, which can make it somewhat difficult to use in combat against giant insects. To make up for this shortcoming, it's been fitted with two machine guns on its rotating turret, which can be manned from either of the two gunner seats. Gunners should be aware, however, that the seats face whatever their respective turrets are aiming at. Since this vehicle needs to transport the electromagnetic railgun, its mobility and functionality alike are a bit lacking -- but compared to traditional weapons, its destructive power is excellent, and its armor level is quite high.

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.

It is also equipped with non-guided bombs that can be thrown straight down, though as with the Blaze Gun, it will be necessary to engage the enemy in close-quarters combat to effectively use them. Its mobility has been improved to the maximum level possible, making it one of the easiest devices to operate in the entire EDF arsenal.

It's also been outfitted with new thrusters, greatly increasing its potential flight distance. Armament-wise, it comes equipped with Combat Burners (in other words, flamethrowers) as well as Canister Shots on both arms, allowing it to attack enemies over a wide area (albeit only from a short distance away). Can also penetrate objects to defeat several enemies at once. After jumping, pressing the jump button again will activate the jet thrusters, allowing for short periods of flight.

A vehicle equipped with a high-performance railgun known as a 'Blast Menace Electromagnetic Launcher.' This gun fires penetrating shells rapidly and comes equipped with a laser sight, allowing the target trajectory to be fully confirmed via a red line before letting loose. This is a very powerful weapon, but it lacks the blast area of the Howitzer, which can make it somewhat difficult to use in combat against giant insects. To make up for this shortcoming, it's been fitted with two machine guns on its rotating turret, which can be manned from either of the two gunner seats. Gunners should be aware, however, that the seats face whatever their respective turrets are aiming at. Since this vehicle needs to transport the electromagnetic railgun, its mobility and functionality alike are a bit lacking -- but compared to traditional weapons, its destructive power is excellent, and its armor level is quite high.

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.

A high-performance Caravan Armored Vehicle. Its healing speed and the amount of medicine it can carry has been increased to the max, and its movement speed and maneuverability have seen significant improvements as well. It is the most powerful support vehicle the EDF has to offer.

Aside from the pilot, there are rear compartments for up to three troops. While in these 'treatment rooms,' armor will recover piece by piece as the healing process unfolds. Though it has no combat ability, it can prove itself to be an essential asset on the field, possibly even turning the tides of the battle. The amount of medicine carried on board is limited, however. As treatment is being carried out, the recovery value of the medicinal equipment on board is displayed. When this value reaches zero, no more healing will be possible.

Additionally, the weight of its weapons has a negative effect on its mobility, though this is partially compensated for by an improved upper-body rotation speed, making it easier to hit moving targets.

The final battle spec of the Naegling Self-Propelled Rocket, equipped with a Convergence Guided Rocket Cannon. The rockets it fires have a homing feature in order to directly target specific foes, and they separate into small missiles in mid-flight to distribute their damage over as great an area as possible. Because the resulting missiles are small, their individual damage is minor, but the system is designed on the assumption that every last one of them will hit their target. And even when the enemy is moving at a high speed, at least one shot should always hit, meaning some damage will be dealt no matter what. When a target is within its sight, the weapon will automatically establish a positive lock, and it is entirely possible to lock on to several enemies at once.

A huge combat vehicle, spanning a massive 25 meters. Basically a mobile fortress developed for land combat against the giant insects. Easily the strongest armament in the entirety of the EDF. Equipped with a main battleship-class cannon and two rotating turrets, as well as thick armor. The trade-off, however, is that all of these features add to its weight, making it a bit sluggish. Its main cannon is the EDF's state-of-the-art Requiem Gun, originally developed as a naval gun but then later equipped on tanks after reducing the size of its barrel. This has resulted in a further reduction to its initial velocity, so some skill is necessary to hit the desired target.
 
There are two sub-cannons located on top of the main cannon. The main cannons and sub-cannons all rotate, and due to the location of the sub-cannons, the direction they face will change as the main cannon is rotated as well. There are also Grenade Dischargers equipped on both the left and right sides of the vehicle to halt any approaching creatures in their tracks.

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats.

A vehicle equipped with a high-performance rail gun known as the 'E2 Blast Menace Electromagnetic Launcher.' This gun fires penetrating shells rapidly and comes equipped with a laser sight, allowing the target trajectory to be fully confirmed via a red line before letting loose. This is a very powerful weapon, but it lacks the blast area of the Howitzer, which can make it somewhat difficult to use in combat against giant insects. To make up for this shortcoming, it's been fitted with two machine guns on its rotating turret, which can be manned from either of the two gunner seats. Gunners should be aware, however, that the seats face whatever their respective turrets are aiming at. Since this vehicle needs to transport the electromagnetic railgun, its mobility and functionality alike are a bit lacking -- but compared to traditional weapons, its destructive power is excellent, and its armor level is quite high.

Only Rangers and Air Raiders can pilot this vehicle, though anyone can ride in the gunners' seats. 

Before you're permitted to use this, you'll need to earn a certain number of credits during the mission by defeating enemies. Your allies' kills will help contribute toward this as well.

The final battle spec of the EF24 Bazelart, featuring the most advanced maneuverability of any model in the entire line. Its takeoff performance is excellent and it can reach high altitudes quickly. This is easily the most powerful attack helicopter there is.

A custom version of the Depth Crawler IV that's been tweaked almost beyond recognition. Now comes equipped with heavy Rapid Bazookas, yet suffers no loss of mobility as a result. These bazookas fire powerful rockets consecutively and do a great deal of damage to enemies.

The final spec for the combat vehicle Gigantus, which has now reached the absolute peak of its potential. Its main cannon is a 140mm Howitzer which fires charges that detonate on impact, causing extensive damage over a fairly wide area.

<h3>Walking Fortress Balam Type F</h3>

Based on the combat data taken during previous missions, it was clear that a walking fortress Balam is simply not cut out for fighting against giant insects. As a result of this finding, the EDF decided to limit its usage and enhance its performance to fight against Erginus instead. Through a host of improvements, the EDF succeeded in increasing its combat ability to the utmost limit, removing extraneous additions like turrets to boost its overall performance.
